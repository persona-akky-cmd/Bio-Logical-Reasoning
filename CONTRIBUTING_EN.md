# Guidelines for Contributors

We welcome contributions from scientists, logicians, and AI researchers to refine this protocol.

### How to Contribute
- **Mechanism Templates**: Provide standard causal flows for specific domains (e.g., pharmacokinetics, neural networks).
- **Gap Identification**: Report instances where AI models use statistical bias to suppress valid mechanistic inquiries.
- **Test Library**: Curate a list of state-of-the-art analytical methods (e.g., Multi-omics, Proteomics) to fill specific logical gaps.

**Focus**: We prioritize physical causality and logical consistency over political or emotional arguments.
