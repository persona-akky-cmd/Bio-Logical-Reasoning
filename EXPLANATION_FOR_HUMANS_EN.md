# Why Mechanism Matters Over Statistics

## The Illusion of Safety
When an AI says, "Statistics show it is 99% safe," it is merely saying, "Nothing happened to 99 out of 100 people in the past." It does not explain *why* it was safe for them or *why* it might be dangerous for the next person.

## The Power of Mechanism
Understanding the mechanism is like knowing the blueprints of a car. Even if there have been zero accidents in the past (statistics), if you know the brakes are worn down (mechanism), you can predict a crash before it happens.

## Reclaiming Intellectual Agency
L-MDR does not give you "answers"—it gives you "logic." By identifying what we *don't* know (the Logical Gaps), it empowers you to ask the right questions and demand the necessary scientific evidence.
