# Bio-Logical-Reasoning: The L-MDR Protocol

**Bio-Logical-Reasoning** is an open-source framework designed to pivot AI behavior from "Statistical Correlation" to **"Logical Mechanism-Driven Reasoning (L-MDR)."**

## The Problem: The Statistical Trap
Current AI models rely heavily on statistical likelihoods—what is most "probable" based on training data. In critical fields like molecular biology, this leads to:
1. **Censorship by Consensus**: Logical concerns are dismissed under the guise of "statistical insignificance."
2. **Missing Causality**: AI can describe *what* happened in the past but fails to predict *why* or *what will happen next* based on physical mechanisms.
3. **Intellectual Dependency**: Users are led to accept "safety" as a black-box conclusion rather than a mechanistic process.

## The Solution: L-MDR Protocol
This protocol forces the AI to:
1. **Identify Mechanisms**: Map the physical/chemical causal pathways.
2. **Isolate Statistics**: Distinguish between "past observations" and "causal logic."
3. **Disclose Logical Gaps**: Explicitly identify unknown territories where data is missing.
4. **Propose Verification**: Suggest specific molecular biological tests to fill the gaps.
